    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>Welcome to my profile! I'm a curious and driven individual pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Telecommunications. My interests lie in the intersection of mathematics, physics, and computer science, and I find great satisfaction in applying this knowledge to solve engineering problems.</p>

       <p>I'm always seeking new challenges and opportunities to grow. As a member of the compèring team, I developed strong communication skills and presented to hundreds of students and parents. I'm also proud to have been part of the GSRacers team that won the Best Business Presentation and Innovation award at the national level EFFI-QUE competition.</p> 
        
       <p>Currently, I'm sharpening my technical skills in computer programming and electronics, and I'm passionate about entrepreneurship. I'm excited to connect with like-minded professionals, share ideas, and explore new possibilities
